    "After a meeting with him, he defined his business aim and informed me about the criteriaâ€™s like following, it should be:\n",
    "1. Opened in one of the big Cities of United Kingdom (Population over 100.000 and more).\n",
    "2. Within the max. 15 minutes walking distance from the Geographical coordinates of the City Center\n",
    "3. As far away from other vegan cafe as possible\n",
    "4. As close as possible to Hotels, because guests of the in-city hotels are generally tended to eat vegan cuisine nearby.\n",
    "5. Population of the city also counts as a positive measure too. (City should be as crowded as possible)\n",
    "6. And many city dwellers should love vegetarian cuisine"
