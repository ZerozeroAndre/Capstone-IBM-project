    "2. Within the max. 15 minutes walking distance from the Geographical coordinates of the City Center\n",

    "4. As close as possible to Hotels, because guests of the in-city hotels are generally tended to eat vegan cuisine nearby.\n",

One of the biggest problems in this project, I would say source of the Venue Data. We are using a USA based Data supplier , Foursquare to judge places venues in the Russia , this data seem to be missing and in some parts are not suitable to our problem. Tagging of venues are made from the Foursquare users , I am assuming they are mainly not Russian. It is highly possible some of venues are wrong tagged or skipped, not listed in api call results. So, as a further improvement one can go professional and buy a real data set especially prepared for the Russia (or any other country in your analyzes)."

    "In this project I wanted to create and solve a real-life problem rather than repeating the classical clustering assignment from our course. I made this assignment much more complicated than the necessary and because of that, I have to spent too much time than the normal case as you appreciate. But just because of that complexity and, having no example in front of me, I have learned too many things from this project. I had to think and find ideas myself like, weight matrix, customer wishes, adapting all those to still our assignment guidelines. So, it may include some wrong conceptions, but still I hope enjoy reading and evaluating it. I hope this project will help me the find a right role in the Data Science world."
